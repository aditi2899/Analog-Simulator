# Analog-Simulator

In this report, the creation of an interactive simulation platform for electrical circuits and
power electronics converters is described. Faulty and under-optimized procedures have no
place in today's technology environments. It's critical to be able to prevent these activities in
order to maintain systems updated and working smoothly. A variety of methods, such as
simulation, can be used to ensure it.
Current circuit simulation flows according the following below:
'Circuit Description' → 'Circuit Analysis' → 'Circuit Results Output'
Transients are abrupt bursts of energy in an electrical circuit that might cause harm to
particular circuit components. Normally, a transient causes the state of the components in
an electrical circuit to change. In an electrical circuit, assuming a new steady state value for
the capacitor voltage and inductor current is extremely challenging. Numerical methods are
one of the best techniques in solving almost all mathematical equations that cannot be
solved analytically
Since the previous century, numerical methods for solving systems of linear algebraic
equations and systems of differential equations have been discovered. The majority of
numerical methods are quite precise and quick. However, some complex issues, such as
stiff difficulties and bad-conditional equations, might arise, which might be computationally
intensive. The example of an electrical circuit with a parasitic capacity for demonstrating
computational problems will be shown and presented in this report.
The computer-aided modelling and simulation serves as a powerful scientific tool, which
can be used to investigate complex systems within different problem domains but the
simulation platform currently available requires a lot of time and space to run. Due to the
lack of facilities many people don't have the access to resources that could run heavy
simulation platforms like MATLAB. So, we decided to develop an interactive simulation
platform that could work on basic Android mobile phones.
